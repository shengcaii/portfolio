        I'm a student at Technological University of Thanlyin studying civil engineering and also dive into web development as a hobby. I love to make things easier and more efficient especially in automated tasks by utitlizing the programming tricks and tools. There are a lot of resources and authors that had given me as a grip to climb up the ladder of programming. I'm still learning and I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities.
