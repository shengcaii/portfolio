        I'm a civil engineering student at Technological University of Thanlyin, but I also enjoy web development as a hobby. I love finding ways to make things easier and more efficient, especially by automating tasks with programming tools and tricks. Along the way, I've learned a lot from great resources and authors who have helped me grow. I'm still learning and always open to new ideas and opportunities!
